# More useful history in add card
## Rationale
In "add card" window, the card history is useless for me. It may be great if your first field contains useful
information, but in my usecase, it only contains the url the information come from. This ensure that the start of the
"history" contains the content of the sort field, which usually contains more information.

A lot of my fields are empty, this add-on removes them from the history button.

I know what the history button is for and assume most people familiar enough with anki to install add-on knows to or can
figure quickly. So removing "edit:" (or its local translation), add place for useful content.

## Config

The number of character to display when clicking the history button.


## TODO

Allow to display only some fields
